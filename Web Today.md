Since the 1990s and the rise of **Web 2.0**, internet users are no longer just passive consumers: they now actively participate by creating and sharing content online.  
Web usage has expanded into several main areas:

### **1. Information Sharing**

Websites like **Wikipedia**, **Wikitravel**, and **Wikileaks** allow users to share and update information collaboratively.

- _Wikipedia_ provides general knowledge constantly updated by users;
- _Wikitravel_ offers travel advice;
- _Wikileaks_ publishes confidential documents, often of political importance;

### **2. Social Networking**

Platforms such as **Facebook** and **Instagram** help users:

- Create personal profiles;
- Stay in touch with friends;
- Share messages, music, videos, and photos;
- Make new connections;

### **3. Blogging**

A **blog** is a personal site, similar to a digital diary, where the blogger regularly posts thoughts, info, and links.

- Blogs are interactive and often include photos, audio, videos, and links;
- **Twitter** is a popular microblog with shorter, frequent posts;
- A **forum** is a site for group discussions based on shared interests;

### **4. Shopping**

Online shops (like **Amazon** or **iTunes**) and auction sites (**eBay**) let users buy and sell items easily. 

- Advantages: Itâ€™s cheaper, faster, and more convenient;
- Disadvantage: Risk of fraud and scams;

### **5. Virtual Worlds and Gaming**

Sites like **Second Life** allow users to create avatars and interact in digital worlds.  
Other platforms (e.g., **Zynga**) offer multiplayer games, gambling, or betting, which are becoming increasingly popular.

### **6. Entertainment Sharing**

Sites like **YouTube** and **Spotify** give access to music and videos, usually in streaming.

- Some allow downloads, others only viewing/listening;
- Platforms like **Flickr** let users upload and share their photos;
- Some illegal sites distribute copyrighted material without permission;
