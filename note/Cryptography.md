Cryptography is the study and practice of hiding information so that only those having a special knowledge can read and process it.

It means scrambling a plaintext into ciphertext through a process called encryption and then back again through decryption.

Encryption is the process of transforming information using an algorithm or cipher to make it unreadable to anyone except those possessing a special knowledge (called _key_). The result is encrypted data.

Decryption is the opposite process and takes place when the key is used to convert the data back into its original form.

There are two types of cryptography according to the type of key:

-  **Asymmetrical Cryptography** is a system using a pair of related keys. Any person can encrypt a message using the public key, but only the holder of the private key can decrypt the message;

-  **Symmetrical Cryptography** is a system that uses the same key for encryption and decryption. The keys may be identical or just slightly different.


Digital signatures are an example of public key cryptography. In fact, a message signed with the sender’s private key can be verified by anyone who has access to the sender’s public key.

Modern cryptography has four objectives:

1. **Confidentiality**: the information cannot be understood by people for whom it was not intended;
2. **Integrity**: the information cannot be altered;
3. **Non-repudiation**: the creator or sender of the information cannot deny at a later stage his/her intentions in the creation or transmission of the information;
4. **Authentication**: the sender and the receiver can confirm each other’s identity.
