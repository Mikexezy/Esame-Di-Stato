**Traditional applications** are heavy programs that require a lot of memory and are used to perform general tasks (e.g., accounting or data processing).  
**Web apps**, on the other hand, are much lighter and designed to perform a single, specific task.

A good example is **Google Maps**, which offers useful features directly in your browser. With it, you can:

- Zoom in or out of a map;
- Move around the map;
- Search for places like restaurants;
- Get directions from one point to another;

### **Main Advantages of Web Apps**

#### 1. **Access from Anywhere**

Web apps store your data online, so you can access it from any device with an internet connection. You don’t need to carry your personal computer with you — your files, emails, and documents are always available through a browser.

#### 2. **Always Updated**

Web apps don’t need to be updated manually. Every time you open them, you’re already using the latest version with new features and security improvements, unlike traditional software that requires frequent and often slow updates.

#### 3. **Work on Any Device**

A web app works on any device with a browser — computer, tablet, or phone — no matter the operating system. You’re not limited to Windows or Mac like with many traditional programs, making everything more flexible and user-friendly.

#### 4. **More Secure**

Since web apps run inside a browser and store data on secure online servers, they’re less exposed to malware or viruses. The separation between your device and the app's code also helps protect your system from harmful software.

“App” is the short form for “application”.
Traditional applications are large, memory-heavy programs used for general tasks, like accounting or data processing.
But **Web Apps** are much lighter and are used for **one specific task**.

## The benefits

1. **You can access your data from anywhere**
    
	Web apps store data online, so you can open them from any computer connected to the internet, just using a browser.
	With traditional applications, the data is stored on the hard drive, so you can’t access it if you’re not using your own computer.
<br>

2. **You always get the latest version of the app**
    
	Web apps update automatically with new features and improvements.
	Traditional apps need to be updated manually and the process can take a long time.
<br>

3. **They work on any device with a web browser**
    
	You can use a Web App from a PC, a laptop or a mobile phone — even from a friend’s computer or in a café.
	Traditional applications often work only on specific systems, like PC or Mac.
<br>

4. **They are safer**
    
	Web Apps are better protected from viruses, malware and spyware.
	This is because the app code is separate from the computer code, so apps can’t   interfere with your system.
	Traditional apps are riskier because they can contain harmful software.
<br>

So, Web Apps are light, safe, and easy to use from anywhere, with any device connected to the internet.
