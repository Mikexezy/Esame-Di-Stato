**Traditional applications** are heavy programs that require a lot of memory and are used to perform general tasks (e.g., accounting or data processing).  
**Web apps**, on the other hand, are much lighter and designed to perform a single, specific task.

A good example is **Google Maps**, which offers useful features directly in your browser. With it, you can:

- Zoom in or out of a map;
- Move around the map;
- Search for places like restaurants;
- Get directions from one point to another;

### **Main Advantages of Web Apps**

#### 1. **Access from Anywhere**

Web apps store your data online, so you can access it from any device with an internet connection. So you don’t need to carry your personal computer with you.

#### 2. **Always Updated**

Web apps don’t need to be updated manually. Every time you open them, you’re already using the latest version with new features and security improvements, unlike traditional software that requires frequent and often slow updates.

#### 3. **Work on Any Device**

A web app works on any device with a browser. You’re not limited to Windows or Mac like with many traditional programs, making everything more flexible and user-friendly.

#### 4. **More Secure**

Since web apps run inside a browser and store data on secure online servers, they’re less exposed to malware or viruses. The separation between your device and the app's code also helps protect your system from harmful software.
