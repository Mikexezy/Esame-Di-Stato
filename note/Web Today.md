The very first websites were just for finding information. But then, around 2000, Web 2.0 arrived. This was a big change because it made users more active â€“ we could create content, not just consume it.
<br>

1. One big part is **Information Sharing**. Think about Wikipedia. It's a collaborative site, meaning many people update it, and 'Wiki' actually means 'quick.' We also have Wikitravel for travel info, and Wikileaks for documents.
<br>
2. Then there's **Social Networking**, which is huge. Facebook and Instagram are perfect examples. We use them to make personal pages, keep in touch with friends, and share messages, photos, and videos.
<br>
3. Next, we have **Blogging**. A blog is like an online diary, updated regularly. It can have text, pictures, and links. Twitter is a good example, but for shorter messages. And a forum is a place where people with similar interests can discuss things.
<br>
4. Another very important use is **Shopping**. There are so many online shops like Amazon for books or music, and auction sites like eBay. It's cheaper and more convenient, but we must be careful of online fraud.
<br>
5. We also have **Virtual Worlds and Gaming**. Sites like Second Life allow users to interact with virtual characters. And there are many online games, plus things like online casinos.
<br>
6. Finally, **Entertainment Sharing**. YouTube and Spotify are great examples for videos and music. We can download or stream content. Flickr is for photos. But it's important to remember that some sites offering entertainment illegally break copyright laws.
