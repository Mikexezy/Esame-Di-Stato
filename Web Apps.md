“App” is the short form for “application”.

Traditional applications are large, memory-heavy programs used for general tasks, like accounting or data processing.

But **Web Apps** are much lighter and are used for **one specific task**.


A good example of a Web App is **Google Maps**, which works inside a web browser.

With Google Maps, you can:

- Increase or decrease the scale of a map or picture
    
- Move around a map or picture using your screen
    
- Search for restaurants
    
- Get directions


**1. You can access your data from anywhere**

Web apps store data online, so you can open them from any computer connected to the internet, just using a browser.

With traditional applications, the data is stored on the hard drive, so you can’t access it if you’re not using your own computer.

  

**2. You always get the latest version of the app**

Web apps update automatically with new features and improvements.

Traditional apps need to be updated manually and the process can take a long time.

  

**3. They work on any device with a web browser**

You can use a Web App from a PC, a laptop or a mobile phone — even from a friend’s computer or in a café.

Traditional applications often work only on specific systems, like PC or Mac.

  

**4. They are safer**

Web Apps are better protected from viruses, malware and spyware.

This is because the app code is separate from the computer code, so apps can’t interfere with your system.

Traditional apps are riskier because they can contain harmful software.


So, Web Apps are light, safe, and easy to use from anywhere, with any device connected to the internet.
